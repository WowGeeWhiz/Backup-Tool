# Backup-Tool
This is a program to backup a local directory to a new local directory. The program can save directory paths for ease-of-use
The program can also save a 'preset' backup. The program can save the input and output directories together to easily repeat backups.
It is built using windows forms. I plan to make further updates to improve the overall design and document the code properly.
I also plan to update/add some functionalities to this project.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
